Have you ever want to print text, but it just prints *too* fast?
SlugPrint, and specify the print speed. Even fast is slow. 

Specify custom pause characters and their pause duration, otherwise it will pause on ., !, ?, and long pause on ...
Custom pause characters can be more than one character in length. Confusing, I know.

This will at some point contain actual documentation. But for the time being, just look at you the code and figure it out.
