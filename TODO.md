# Random notes on features to implement
---

Keypresses during print having different actions (currently, nothing is set up to listen for keypresses)

    - E: immediately print remaining text
    - N: Immediately print rest of line
    - P: pause printing
    - R: resume printing
    - Q: quit without printing remaining text
    - S: Toggle to Slow Print
    - M: Toggle to Medium Print
    - F: Toggle to Fast Print

I'm not sure if this is possible to implement for browser, this may need to be a console only feature
